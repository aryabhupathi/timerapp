# Timer App Updates

## Overview
This update enhances the Timer App by allowing multiple timers to run simultaneously, improving snack bar behavior, refactoring code for maintainability, and ensuring data persistence. Additionally, comprehensive tests have been added for validation logic and reusable components.

## Completed Features

###  Simultaneous Timers
- The app now supports multiple timers running at the same time.
- Each timer operates independently with its own countdown and completion notifications.

###  Snack Bar Behavior
- When a timer completes, a snack bar notification is displayed.
- The notification sound continues playing until the user dismisses the snack bar.
- The console error when dismissing a snack bar has been resolved.

###  Extracted Common Components
- The buttons in the Add/Edit Timer Modal have been extracted into a reusable component.
- All instances of similar buttons across the app have been replaced with this component.

###  Consolidated Modal Code
- A single reusable modal component is now used for both adding and editing timers.
- Code duplication has been eliminated, improving maintainability.

###  Validation Snack Bars
- Instead of disabling the Submit button when the form is invalid, an error snack bar now appears when an invalid form is submitted.
- This provides immediate feedback to the user.

###  Responsive Snack Bar Placement
- For **desktop devices**: Snack bars appear in the **top-right corner**.
- For **mobile devices**: Snack bars appear at the **bottom of the screen**.

###  Testing
- **Unit tests** have been added for the `validation.ts` file to ensure all validation rules work correctly.
- **Component tests** have been written for `TimerItem` and `ModalButtons` to ensure proper functionality and reusability.

## Conclusion
All requested updates and improvements have been successfully implemented. The app now offers a more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable experience with better timer management, improved UI behavior, and reliable data storage.
